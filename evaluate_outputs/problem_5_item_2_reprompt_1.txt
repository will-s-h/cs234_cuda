Alright, I need to provide a correctly formatted CUDA source and C++ source code based on the user's instructions. However, I noticed that my previous attempt had an issue with formatting. Let me try again.

The user's examples show that the CUDA source includes the kernel function and the forward method. The C++ source is just the method declaration.

I'll structure the CUDA source with proper formatting for the kernel and the forward function. The kernel should be in .cur CUDA source, and the forward function in .cpp source.

Here's the corrected CUDA code:

```cuda_source
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <shared_buffer.h>

__global__ void matmul_kernel(const float* A, const float* B, float* C, int M, int N, int K) {
    int i = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int j = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    // Load row i of A into shared buffer
    for (int k = 0; k < K; k += 16) {
        shared buffer[blockRow * 16 + k] = A[blockRow * K + k];
    }

    // Load column j of B into shared buffer
    shared buffer[blockCol * 16 + j] = B[blockCol * K + j];
    __syncthreads();

    // Multiply and accumulate the elements in shared buffer
    for (int n = 0; n < 16; ++n) {
        if (n < K / 16) {
            float temp = buffer[0];
            for (int l = 0; l < 16; ++l) {
                temp *= buffer[l + n];
            }
            C[blockRow * N + blockCol] = temp;
        }
    }
}

torch::Tensor forward(torch::Tensor A, torch::Tensor B) {
    int M = A.size(0), N = B.size(1), K = A.size(1);
    auto size = M * N;
    auto C = torch::zeros(M, N);

    int block_size = 256;
    int num_blocks = (M + block_size - 1) / block_size;

    matmul_kernel<<<num_blocks, block_size>>>(A.data_ptr(), B.data_ptr(), C.data_ptr(), M, N, K);

    return C;
}
```

And the corresponding C++ source code remains the same:

```cpp_source
torch::Tensor forward(torch::Tensor A, torch::Tensor B);
```

I apologize for the formatting issues in my previous attempt. This response follows the required structure and includes the correct CUDA source and C++ source as specified.
