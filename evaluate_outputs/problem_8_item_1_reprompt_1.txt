Alright, I'll try to come up with an optimized CUDA implementation for the matrix multiplication. The original PyTorch implementation is straightforward, but using CUDA allows for better performance through parallelism.

First, I'll consider the matrix dimensions. If M >> N or N >> M, it's more efficient to split the matrices into smaller blocks for multiplication.

I'll implement a blocked matrix multiplication where each thread block handles a portion of the matrix. This reduces the number of global memory accesses, which are slow on the GPU.

I'll use shared memory within each thread block to store a portion of the matrices. This is faster than accessing global memory.

I'll also take advantage of the fact that multiplying a row (from matrix A) by a column (from matrix B) is a vector dot product. By precomputing the elements of these vectors in shared memory, I can perform the multiplication using a fused multiply-add (FMA) operation for speed.

To ensure alignment, I'll compute the correct stride for the vectors in shared memory. This way, all accesses are coalesced, maximizing memory bandwidth.

Here's how I can structure the CUDA code:

1. Define the grid and block dimensions based on the matrix dimensions.
2. Precompute the vector sizes to ensure they fit in shared memory.
3. Load the vectors into shared memory with padding for alignment.
4. Compute each element of the resulting matrix using the preloaded vectors.
5. Store the result in global memory.
6. Optimize by compiling the CUDA code with appropriate compiler flags.

I'll include all necessary headers, like `torch/extension.h` for CuDNN compatibility and `cuda_runtime.h` for CUDA runtime functions.

Additionally, I'll make sure the custom forward function only calls the kernel once, reducing kernel launches and potential overhead.

Finally, I'll compile and test the CUDA code using PyTorch's `torch.compile` to verify correctness and performance.

This implementation:
1. Uses shared memory on the GPU for local computations
2. Exploits parallelism with thread blocks
3. Reduces global memory accesses which are slow on GPUs
4. Uses coalesced memory accesses for better memory bandwidth usage
5. Optimizes for common patterns in matrix multiplication
