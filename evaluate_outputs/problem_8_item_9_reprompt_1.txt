Alright, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to optimize the matrix multiplication kernel. The existing `torch.matmul` is too high-level and not optimized for CUDA. To get the best performance, I should implement a custom CUDA kernel that uses shared memory and efficient memory access patterns.

The key optimizations are:
1. **Shared Memory Utilization**: Using shared memory to reduce global memory latency during the multiplication.
2. **Constant Thread Block Size**: Choosing a block size that allows for the most efficient occupancy. For CUDA, a block size of 256 is commonly effective.
3. **Memory Alignment**: Ensuring that the input and output tensors are aligned in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts and improve memory access patterns.
4. **Avoid Scalar Operations**: Using matrix operations within the kernel to reduce the number of operations and increase throughput.

Let's structure the CUDA kernel:

1. **Kernel Launch Configuration**: The grid and block dimensions. For a batch matrix multiplication, using a grid size that is a multiple of the block size (e.g., 2 * block_size) ensures efficient resource usage.
2. **Shared Memory Access**: Each thread block will load a sub-matrix of A and B into shared memory to reduce global memory access.
3. **Matrix Multiplication in Shared Memory**: Within each block, each thread will compute its part of the output matrix by multiplying corresponding elements from the loaded sub-matrices.
4. **Output Storeback**: After all computations within a block are done, each thread will store its part of the output matrix back into global memory.

I will also ensure that the kernel uses `float` precision for better performance on CUDA hardware.

Considering the dimensions of the input matrices (M x K and K x N), the block size is chosen such that it efficiently divides these dimensions, ensuring minimal divergence and maximum thread occupancy.

Now, I'll implement these optimizations in the CUDA kernel.
