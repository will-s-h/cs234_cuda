To replace the matrix multiplication with a custom CUDA kernel for better performance, we need to implement a parallelized version of the 3D tensor-matrix multiplication. This will utilize CUDA's parallelism to speed up the computation by offloading the main CPU task to the GPU.

### Approach
The custom CUDA kernel will perform the matrix multiplication operation in parallel across multiple CUDA threads. Each thread will handle a single element of the resulting tensor by computing the dot product of the corresponding row from tensor A and the entire vector from matrix B. This approach fully utilizes CUDA's compute capability by assigning each thread to a unique computation task, maximizing GPU utilization.

### Solution Code
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Performs 3D tensor-matrix multiplication using a custom CUDA kernel.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, A, B):
        """

        Args:
            A (torch.Tensor): Input 3D tensor of shape (N, M, K).
            B (torch.Tensor): Input matrix of shape (K, L).

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: Output tensor of shape (N, M, L).
        """
        N = A.size(0)
        M = A.size(1)
        L = B.size(1)

        # Calculate grid dimensions
        blocksPerGrid = (A.size(2) + 255) // 256  # Equivalent to ceil division

        # Define the CUDA kernel
        __global__ void matmulKernel(int N, int M, int L, const float* A_data, const float* B_data, float* C_data) {
            int n = blockIdx.x;
            int m = blockIdx.y;
            int k = blockIdx.z;
            int thread_id = threadIdx.x;

            if (thread_id >= M) {
                return;
            }

            float sum = 0.0f;
            for (int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
                sum += A_data[n * M * K + m * K + i] * B_data[k * L + i];
            }

            C_data[n * M * L + m * L + thread_id] = sum;
        }

        // Allocate output tensor and set up kernel execution
        torch::Tensor C(N, M, L);
        auto C_data = C.data_ptr<float>();

        const int threadsPerBlock = 256;
        const int blocksPerGrid = blocksPerGrid;

        // Launch the kernel with proper block and grid dimensions
        matmulKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(N, M, L, A.data_ptr<float>(), B.data_ptr<float>(), C_data);

        return C;
```

### Explanation
- **Custom CUDA Kernel**: The `matmulKernel` function is defined to compute the dot product of elements from the input tensors A and B for each element in the output tensor C. Each thread in CUDA handles a specific computation, ensuring maximum parallelism.
- **Grid Dimensions**: The grid dimensions are calculated based on the size of tensor A to determine how many blocks and threads are needed for the computation.
- **Memory Management**: The output tensor C is allocated, and its memory address is used to execute the CUDA kernel. The kernel modifies the memory address of C to store the computed values.
- **Launch Configuration**: The kernel is launched with the computed grid and thread dimensions to maximize GPU utilization and efficiency.

This approach ensures that the matrix multiplication is performed efficiently using CUDA, providing significant speedups compared to the standard CPU implementation.
