When I ran the first attempt, I received an error message saying that Ninja was not found. I don't know if that's correct or if it's just the first time. I was able to install Ninja via Homebrew, but perhaps I need to have C++ compiler tools installed as well. I don't have them, so the installation of the extension may fail. I'm sorry for the extra confusion.
