You might want to look at the first two examples to get a sense of the correct format, but your code needs to be unique and different from them.

Okay, I need to figure out why the previous attempt failed. The error message indicates that Ninja is required to load C++ extensions, which suggests that the build process encountered an issue. Maybe the code wasn't properly optimized for CUDA or had compatibility issues.

Looking back at the previous attempt, the custom kernel used `dimK`, which might not be correctly handled in PyTorch's extension. Let me adjust the kernel to use `dim` instead and make sure all dimensions are correctly indexed. I'll also ensure the shared code is correctly formatted and compatible with the provided architecture.

I'll modify the CUDA source to use `dim` consistently and adjust the indexing in the kernel. Additionally, I'll ensure the PyTorch extension code is correctly aligned with the kernel's expected parameters.

Here's the revised attempt:
