The issue is that my code has shared memory usage which isn't allowed in CUDA compilation. How can I fix this?
</think>

To fix the issue with shared memory usage, I need to modify the CUDA kernel to use register arithmetic instead. This avoids the need for shared memory and makes the code more compatible.

Here's the corrected CUDA source:

```cuda_source = """
#include <torch/extension.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void matmulKernel(const float* A, const float* B, float* C, int M, int N, int K) {
    int tx = threadIdx.x;
    int ty = threadIdx.y;

    __syncthreads();

    for (int k = 0; k < K; ++k) {
        const float a_val = A[ty + tx * N + k * M];
        const float b_val = B[ty + tx * N + k * M];
        C[ty + tx * N + k * M] = a_val * b_val;
    }
}

torch::Tensor forward(torch::Tensor A, torch::Tensor B) {
    auto M = A.size(0);
    auto K = A.size(1);
    auto N = B.size(1);

    // Allocate space on the device for the result
    std::vector<int> sizes = {M, N};
    std::vector<int> strides = {1, N};
    auto C = torch::zeros(M, N, K, sizeof(float), device: A.device());

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (M + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    matmulKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(A.data_ptr(), B.data_ptr(), C.data_ptr(), M, N, K);

    return C;
}
"""
```

And the cpp_source remains unchanged:

```cpp_source = (
    "torch::Tensor forward(torch::Tensor A, torch::Tensor B);"
)
```

This implementation removes shared memory usage and instead uses direct memory access with register arithmetic, making it fully compliant with CUDA compilation rules.
