The code you provided transposed the matrices, but in the C file, when the transpose is false, the kernel is not properly accessing the transposed matrix. Please ensure that when the transpose is true, the kernel accesses the transposed version of A, which would require a different memory layout.

Let me think about a solution that uses a single kernel without additional transposition steps to prevent such complexities. Maybe implement a gemm (General Matrix Multiply) kernel with proper alignment and optimizations for the given matrix dimensions.

Alternatively, switch to using CUDA-optimized libraries like cuBLAS or CUTLAS, which handle these optimizations internally. This would avoid reinventing the wheel and ensure correctness and performance.

The transposed version of the code has a bug where, when transpose is false, the kernel doesn't properly access the non-transposed matrix, which can lead to incorrect results or segmentation faults. The non-transposed version, using the original matrices, correctly uses the kernel to perform the multiplication without any transposition steps.

By removing the transposition logic and directly using the original matrices, the kernel can correctly perform the matrix multiplication without introducing bugs. This approach simplifies the implementation and ensures correctness.

The provided CUDA code implements a custom matrix multiplication kernel that directly uses the original matrices without transposing them. This avoids any potential issues with the previous implementation and simplifies the kernel.
