You may also consider other operators, fusion opportunities, or algorithmic changes. However, the code I created earlier was the first attempt. It was a straightforward kernel for matrix multiplication, implementing the matmul function in CUDA using shared memory for efficiency. However, upon trying to compile it, I encountered a runtime error because ninja wasn't available. 

I remember reading that PyTorch requires ninja to build C++ extensions. Perhaps in the environment where I tried running the code, ninja was not installed or was not accessible. I should verify if ninja is installed in that environment. If ninja is not installed, the code would fail to compile. 

If ninja is installed, then the code should compile successfully. The forward function uses shared memory to perform the matrix multiplication efficiently. It's a straightforward implementation but might not be the most optimized for very large matrices due to memory constraints. Additionally, I could explore using fused kernels or other optimizations to improve performance further.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need further optimizations.
