Please note that the user will only give the model class, so only the code that should be generated from that model is shown here.

Additionally, the example code uses float precision, but your code can use any precision (e.g., double, or even bfloat16, float16) as long as the example can be ported accordingly.

Okay, so I need to generate the correct CUDA source and C++ source code based on the example format.

First, the CUDA source must be a single string containing the full CUDA kernel code, placed inside a __global__ function named 'forward'. It should include the necessary CUDA headers and have appropriate device functions and inline kernels.

The cpp_source should be a single string defining a Torch extension's cpp implementation. It should include the function signature and any necessary type casts or checks. I need to ensure that it only matches the example's format, including using 'torch::Tensor' and only including the forward method.

I should also ensure that the code compiles correctly, using the correct compiler flags (e.g., '-DUSE_GPU').

After fixing the formatting issue, the generated CUDA and cpp sources should match the structure of the examples provided by the user, including using the correct function names and structure.
